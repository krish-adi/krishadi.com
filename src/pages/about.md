Hey there ðŸ‘‹ !

I am Adithya. There are quite a few things that interest me, a lot! To put things into perspective, here is my story, where I try to connect the dots.

When I was a kid, I broke a lot of things at home, out of curiosity to understand how things worked. Watches, radios, projectors, toys (all of them, some 3 or 4 I had ended up in pieces), cameras. When I was about 10, my mom bought me an electronics hobby kit (best birthday gift no. 1). At its core, it had an IC 555 a typical timer circuit, along with it a bunch of transistors, resistors, diodes, switches and a reusable breadbord with wires. I learnt so much from it, by replicating the circuits from the book that came along with it and ofcourse by messing around with connections just to see what would happend, or most importantly why nothing happend.

I started learning western classical music with the EKB (electronic keyboard, piano). It was fascinating to learn, how people had discovered structures in music, understanding how combination of pitches and tones worked, how beauty in music is created by adding imperfections. I even managed to pass a few trinity college exams, upto Grade 5. This gave me some context to start being curious about Indian classical music, especially carnatic music. Delving intro trying to understand how ragas worked, how thalam worked, the rhythm came together. Although, I wish I had a carnatic teacher, who would have probably taught me what all the ragas and thalams were there, how to recognize them (I am very bad at recognizing tones), I may have not enjoyed it so much. I was more curious about the 'why', rather than the 'what'. I wasn't so much interested in what ragas were there, but more into why were ragas, how does it relate to the music it created.

My love with computers started when I was learning music. My dad had bought me a Yamaha PSR-1000 (best birthday gift no. 2). What it could do, was mind blowing. It had a floppy disk reader/writer, where you could record music as MIDI files, and play them back. Record different layers, with different instruments. You could edit them, correct them, loop them. All of this you could do with the keyboard itself. What I had discovered was, there were other people who recorded MIDI files and published them online. This was way back in 1998, internet was this amazing thing. Back then, I didn't have a computer at home. So, I would go to an internet cafe with my dad, browse for MIDI files, download them onto a floppy disk and rush back home to play them. To listen to them, and find out what interesting tunes they were making, and more importantly how they were making it. I always ended up studying the combination of notes, and the instrument arrangement.

... this is writing in progress.

I have a PhD on 'how shit flows' (Domestic Slurry Hydraulics in Transport: D-SHIT) from TU Delft, where I studied the fluid dynamics of faecal sludge to design sewer systems. I have a Master of Science (MSc) in Process technology (Process Systems Engineering, Chemical Engineering) and a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) in the same. I like looking into systems and understanding their behaviour, answering questions like how do they whatever they do, why do they do it and what influences it. I applied this to complex fluids (poop + water happens to be one) and got a PhD out of it.

I like working on web/mobile-applications, cloud-utility projects, data-science and AI/ML projects. I have a expertise in (waste)water management, GIS, Geospatial data, remote-sensing, process (chemical) systems engineering and digital twins.

I started building websites at 12, playing around with html and css. I first hosted a website of MIDI files, when I was playing the keyboard and had a Yamaha PSR 1000. I started writing algorithms to solve prolems in optimizing process systems. Used MATLAB quite a lot. I got into full-stack dev and building web-apps when I wanted to turn my research work into an interact-able app. I love working with Python and JavaScript.

I also work on AI/ML projects that make use of Tensorflow. Currently, I am working on a service that is looking to provide a context aware consumer experience when searching for and buying clothes. Somewhere, in the intersection between AI and E-Commerce. More on that later...

I also love to climb. I have climbed around the world, rock and ice, sport, alpine and trad. Some of my favorite places are the Dolomites in Italy, Sanstone of Berdorf, Cracks in Basalt at Ettringen, Limestones of Freyr. In 2021, I climbed a total of 2900m of rock face in 7 days in the Dolomites.
